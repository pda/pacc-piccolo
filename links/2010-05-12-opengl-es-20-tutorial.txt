An excellent OpenGL tutorial; beware other documentation and tutorials which endorse deprecated APIs and practices.

Modern enough to be applicable to OpenGL ES 2.0 (and therefore [WebGL][1]), which requires vertex and fragment shaders to be written in [OpenGL Shader Language][1] to take advantage of the programmable rendering pipeline, and which removes much of the procedural (glBegin/glEnd) API.

Adapting this tutorial to Cocoa Touch for iPhone/iPad OpenGL ES 2.0 development was relatively easy, and beat any iPhone OS specific documentation for ES 2.0 that I've found.
