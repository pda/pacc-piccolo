<p>I've just upgraded WordPress, and while I was there it seemed a good time to switch from RSS to Atom feeds, and deliver them via FeedBurner.</p>
<p>I've always been interested to see how different feed readers handle a feed switching from RSS to Atom - I guess I'll find out.  The new Atom entry IDs are the same as the old RSS item IDs, so hopefully we wont see duplicated posts...</p>
