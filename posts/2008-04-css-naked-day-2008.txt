<p>Tomorrow is <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day '08</a>, and websites around the intertubes will be stripping their styles and showing off their semantic markup.</p>

<p>I figured I'd <a href="http://paul.annesley.cc/" title="My front page">get the ball rolling</a> a little early, to balance the fact that I'll inevitably forget to re-enable the styles for at least a week afterwards.</p>
