<p>While working with XML-RPC in PHP, I've been frustrated that the only desktop debugging client I could find was the  <a href="http://www.ditchnet.org/xmlrpc/">XML-RPC Client for Mac</a>, which doesn't do me much good in Windows.<br />
I'm going to try and find time to have a go at building such a tool for Windows, either as a Java application or a XUL Firefox Extension - neither of which I have ever written a useful application with.</p>
<p>Some things to consider would be support for HTTP cookies, support for json-rpc as well as XML-RPC, and perhaps a plugin interface to allow addons which are useful for more than just adhoc debugging.
