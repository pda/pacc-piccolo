title: Conflict free DNS and routes with multiple DHCP interfaces
date: 27 October 2009

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Running DHCP on two or more network interfaces inevitably leads to
conflicting or unpredictable DNS and default route settings.</p>

<p>For development at home and work, I use an Ubuntu virtual machine running
on Mac OS.  To ensure I have a predictable IP address regardless of what
network I'm on, the VM primary network interface is <strong>NATed</strong>, so
it gets an IP address from VMware's DHCP server.  To let my co-workers access
HTTP on my virtual machine, I have a second network interface which is
<strong>bridged</strong></p>

<p>The biggest symptom of the problem is complete loss of connectivity when
I switch between home and office, and the default route from the previous
location is retained.</p>

<h2>The Solution That Should Work</h2>

<p><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/dhclient.conf">DHCP client configuration</a>
lets you specify which details you want to request from the DHCP server.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>request</strong> statement</p>

<p><strong>request [ option ] [, ... option ];</strong></p>

<p>The request statement causes the client to request that any server
responding to the client send the client its values for the specified
options. Only the option names should be specified in the request statement
- not option parameters. By default, the DHCP server requests the subnet-mask,
broadcast-address, time-offset, routers, domain-name, domain-name-servers,
host-name, nis-domain, nis-servers, and ntp-servers options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it should be possible to omit 'routers' and 'domain-name-servers' from
the 'request' statement of the bridged interface, and all should be good.
However, it seems that some DHCP servers (like in my Linksys router at home)
send a 'router' anyway, and the DHCP client respects it despite not having
requested it.</p>

<h2>The Solution That Does Work</h2>

<p>The solution that seems to work reliably is to write a simple
dhclient-enter-hook to unset any unwanted details before they are
processed.</p>

<pre><code>&#x000A;# /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/bridged-eth1&#x000A;&#x000A;if [ "$interface" = eth1 -a -n "$new_routers" ]; then&#x000A;        echo Discarding eth1 routers: $new_routers&#x000A;        unset new_routers&#x000A;fi&#x000A;if [ "$interface" = eth1 -a -n "$new_domain_name_servers" ]; then&#x000A;        echo Discarding eth1 dns servers: $new_domain_name_servers&#x000A;        unset new_domain_name_servers&#x000A;fi&#x000A;</code></pre>
